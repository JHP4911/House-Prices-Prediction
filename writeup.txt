-->Steps Performed:

1.)Loaded the train test set into memory.
2.)Dropped one column from train/test due to presence of missing values in that column.
3.)To ensure that no "na" values penetrate droping all those rows, however after removing the above mentioned column, there wasn't any missing value.
4.)Applied lograthhimic trasnformation on the target variable.
5.)Identified some huge outliers in 2 variables , so dropped 3 observation with outlier.
6.)Explored different forms of encoding categoriacl variable and after many solutions performed integer encdoing for ordinal variable and one hot encoding for nominal variable.
7.)Identified few columns that were corelated with each other, hence dropped them.
8.)Performed feature scaling and normalisation to create design matrix.
9.)Applied GradientBoostingRegressor as a part of 1st model selection and tuned its parameter by performing Grid search.
10.)Applied XGBRegressor as a part of 2nd model selection and tuned its parameter by performing Grid search.
11.)Saved the model predictions by taking inverse of lograthim of the output generated by mode.
12.)Conducted model evaluation and generated rmse for each train/test split provided to us. The results are shown below.
